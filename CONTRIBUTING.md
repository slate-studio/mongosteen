We love pull requests. Here’s a quick guide:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in a topic branch.
3. Squash your commits into a single one (more on that [here](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)).
4. Rebase against `origin/master`, push to your fork and submit a pull request.
5. If you are writing a new feature please add documentation for it by making another pull request to the `gh-pages` branch.

At this point you’re waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Fix a bug, refactor code or expand an existing feature.
* Use the right syntax and naming conventions.
* Update parts of the documentation that are affected by your contribution.

**Git Commit Messages**

* Capitalize your commit messages.
* Start your message with a verb.
* Use present tense.
* Refer to the issue/PR number in your squashed commit message.
